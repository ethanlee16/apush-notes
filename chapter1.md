**Introduction**

1. Although no longer referred to as a discovery, the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to the West Indian islands resulted in a series of changes for both Europeans and what they called "the New World."
2. The exchanges made between the indigenous people of the American continent and the Europeans took on many forms, including new crops and foods, the spread of diseases that the Native Americans had not been exposed to, and a system of slavery involving the exploitation of Africa.
3. Whereas the Europeans often benefitted greatly from the exchanges with the Native Americans, which opened up major new routes for trade, the natives suffered what British writer Adam Smith described as "every sort of injustice," along with the Africans forced into slavery.
4. Finding the American continent was for many Europeans, the fulfillment of a dream to discover a land of greater opportunity and a place for religious and social equality, which were both sought as the Europeans settled into communities in America.
5. Many European settlers were able to pursue a dream for economic opportunity in America, but it was largely at the cost of unfair treatment and slave labor of the native peoples and Africans.
6. The diversity of the newcomers to the New World was both because of a time of internal instability within Europe which caused the flight of many Europeans of different backgrounds and the many cultural groups of American Indians and Africans present; this diversity made for difficult interaction at times between separate groups into colonial America.

**The Settling of the Americas:** The New World for the Europeans had been occupied by natives for tens of thousands of years, who originally crossed a land bridge from Asia and developed their own societies and civilizations with adaptations and agriculture.

1. The first Americans arrived through a land bridge over the Bering Strait and resulted in the creation of numerous societies and languages anywhere between 15,000 - 60,000 years ago.
2. As the first Americans dispersed throughout the two American continents 11,000 years ago, many large animals that were a source of food for them became extinct due to climate change, which led to the rise of agriculture in Mesoamerica around the same time as the Agricultural Revolution in western Asia.

**Indian Societies of the Americas:** The inhabitants of the Americas varied in their technological and developmental achievements, as the Mesoamerican and South American regions developed large cities while the North American regions lacked modern central planning.

1. The New World before the arrival of the Europeans was very much developed with roads and complex architecture, especially in the case of the Aztec Empire of modern-day Mexico and the Incan Empire of modern-day Peru, both of which sustained large populations and developed complex roads and city planning.
2. In the modern-day area of the United States, however, the Indian civilizations present did not develop large infrastructure, achive literacy, or become as centrally organized as with the Aztecs or Incans, leading to a European belief that they were in need of European intervention.


**Mound Builders of the Mississippi River Valley:** Along the Mississippi River, many American Indian cultures engaged in a practice of building large mounds for commercial, burial, or religious reasons that remain today in areas such as in the ancient city of Cahokia.

1. What remains of some of the earliest American civilizations include large, dome-like mounds around the Mississippi River, for which Native Americans used as a center for trade in modern-day Louisiana.
2. As far as before 492 BC, Indians referred to as *mound builders* had been creating these structures for burials, which resulted in larger cultures in the Mississippi River Valley such as the mound builders in the city of Cahokia, where a temple was built atop the largest mound.

**Western Indians:** Throughout the Western areas of the United States, Indian communities and villages learned to adapt to the unique climate and resources of that region, as with the desert climate of Arizona or the plentiful buffalo population of the Great Plains.

1. Village life and trade activity thrived in the western region of present-day Arizona, where the Hopi and Zuni tribes built systems for irrigation and eventually, towns to support extended families.
2. Drought eventually overtook these towns and gave rise to mass migration to the southeast, where they adapted to the harsh, dry climate by using farming techniques and irrigation to grow corn and beans.
3. While hunting sea animals and fish like wild salmon and gathering plants was a common source of food for Indians along the Pacific coastline, the Indians of the Great Plains sourced their food primarily from hunting buffalo or agricultural activity.

**Indians of Eastern North America:** In eastern North America, the number of tribes with different kinds of cultures, customs, and religions surprised the Europeans, and these tribes were in continuous interaction with one another through trade, war, or diplomacy.

1. Many different tribes of American Indians were settled in the eastern areas of North America as well, where smaller independent groups often traded or warred in exchanges of diplomacy and revenge.
2. The most signficant part of the discovery of these tribes of eastern North America was, for the Europeans, the massive diversity among the groups, each with separate languages and distinct cultures that resulted in a weak central identity for Indians collectively.

**Native American Religion:** Despite a large gap between independent Native American tribes and groups because of their own languages and customs, their religion commonly involved the spiritual and supernatural within nature.

1. Although fragmented through cultural identity, Native American religion showed a commonality of finding spiritual elements to nature and activities related to farming and hunting.
2. Native American religion did not draw sharp boundaries between the natural and the divine, especially since there was an emphasis on harnessing the spirituality of nature to assist with acts such as healing.


**Land and Property:** Native Americans had differing perspectives on land ownership than the arriving Europeans, and they identified sharing as a more important quality to have than wealth.

1. Indian societies had a different take on landowning, as their land ownership systems generally assigned families with units of land to farm on and live off of, while not owning the land itself; Native Americans saw land as a shared resource between their people and not a privately owned estate.
2. Indians also did not believe in the mass acculumation of wealth and could not sustainably do that since tribes moved periodicaly in any case, and their own tribal leaders were primarily recognized for their generosity instead of their personal possession.
3. Because of a lack of emphasis on private ownership and a stronger value for sharing and charitable giving, there was no extreme inequality for their people even in tribes with a social hierarchy such as the Natchez.

**Gender Relations:** Unlike Europe, the gender relations of the Native Americans did not encourage the subordination of women, as many societies were matrilineal and women could participate in tribal leadership and ownership.

**European Views of the Indians:** Differing views on land ownership, gender roles, and religion caused the Europeans to think of the Indians as savages that did not own settled communities or maintain a proper family unit.

1. The Europeans who encountered the Indians, such as Giovanni de Verrazano from Italy, had polar views on the people, referring to them both as savages and uncivilized in some ways and superior in other ways.
2. The trend of the European thought, however, resulted in a prevailing belief that Indians worshipped superstition rather than a genuine religion and could not be responsible for the land because of their lack of emphasis on private land ownership.
3. Despite the developed agricultural techniques of the Indians and their multiple complex communities, the Europeans (especially the English, Dutch, and French) believed that their supposed failure to utilize the land as an economic resource justified their own stake in America to do so.
4. The Europeans were also critical of the male roles in Indian society, as a lack of strictly Christian male leaders caused them to misunderstand the Indian culture, believing that the males were weak and lazy for hunting instead of doing the household work of females.

**Indian Freedom:** Indians and Europeans differed in their views of freedom, as Indians lived without laws guaranteeing individual rights while the Europeans did not value kinship as strongly as the Indians.

1. Some Europeans thought of the Indians as having limitless freedom because they did not institute any forced labor practices, but freedom itself was not a concept well-known by the Indians, and they did not have a literal translation for the word.
2. The fact that Indians were not governed by laws or centralized bodies caused the Europeans to believe that they lacked all civilization and needed to be organized.
3. Indians, however, had a concept of personal liberties as they resisted some European efforts to subdue their communities into fored labor.
4. Indians also valued familial relationships and the collective well-being of people around them far more than their personal rights, and the respect for spiritual and moral pursuits took precedence in their respective communities.

**Christian Liberty:** European concepts of freedom originated from concepts as old as from ancient Greek writings, and before the colonization of America, the common freedom that the Europeans identified was synonymous with devotion to their specific religion.

1. To Europeans, the idea of freedom was a product of much political history and many writings that created the foundations for modern rights of a person, even before they began colonizing America.
2. A popular opinion in Europe at the time was also the perspective that freedom was one of spiritual nature, which meant for Protestant Christians the abandonment of a life of sin to become truly free.
3. Religious tolerance was not a popular idea during the period before colonization, and all of the European nations had established churches that decreed dogma by which its religious followers were expected to adhere, which effectively meant that Christian liberty was not a concept tied to tolerance.

**Freedom and Authority:** Concepts of freedom within Europe were largely determined by religious justifications from Christianity, namely the submission of wives to their husbands and the authority of the King being ordained by God.

1. In a non-religious context, Europeans made an association of liberty with following the rule of law, which was prevalent in its social hierarchy, especially with the kingdom's aristocracy.
2. In the context of a family unit, European men held legal authority over their wives and children, as they were considered to be represented by the husband's legal identity instead.
3. For European families, this submission of women was a common practice and was based on a divinely-instituted practice as defined by Christianity, which gave a social order for men and women.

**Liberty and Liberties:** European concepts of liberty were somewhat archaic, being drawn from ideas that came from the Middle Ages, which relied on the granting of specific privileges rather than universal independence and individual liberties.

1. In the European social hierarchy, liberty was equivalent to understanding your placement within the European social strata.
2. During the time of colonization, however, many perceptions of European freedom was based on the Middle Ages where liberty was a set of privileges rather than the modern civil liberties of freedom of expression or religion.

**The Expansion of Europe:** The navigation and expeditions of Europe stemmed mostly from a goal to find a trade route by sea from Europe to Asia, which was fulfilled by the Portuguese.

**Chinese and Portuguese Navigation:** Chinese and Portuguese navigational expeditions occurred for separate reasons; for the Chinese, it was a matter of impressing the world with their accomplishments, and for the Portuguese, it was to find a trade route by sea to Asia.

1. Zheng He was a Chinese navigator that led expeditions around the Indian Ocean, with a vast amount of ships and people; however, contrary to the motives of the European expeditions, land-based China did this for its impressive nature rather than for expanding a seaborne empire.
2. Technological advancements, such as navigational equipment like the compass and newer ships like the caravel, allowed the Portuguese to make the voyage down the coast of Africa and return to Portgal.

**Portugal and West Africa:** Portugal's explorations continued through the coast of Africa upon discovering riches of mineral wealth, which were exploited along with Atlantic islands on which the Portuguese created plantations.

1. During the fifteenth century, Mali was known for its extraordinary wealth from gold, which attracted the Portuguese to explore progressively down the coast of Africa, where they created trading posts.
2. Off of the coast of Africa, Portugal began colonizing islands such as the Cape Verde Islands and creating plantations that were worked by slaves.

**Freedom and Slavery in Africa:** The exploitation of African slaves began with the arrival of the Portuguese expeditions, which traveled along the western coast until finding a route by sea to India around the continent.

1. Although slavery existed before the Europeans' arrival for those who had debts or committed crimes, the Portuguese and the other Europeans nations that followed accelerated this trade significantly.
2. In 1487, Bartholomeu Dias of Portugal sailed to the southern tip of Africa (the Cape of Good Hope), and by 1498, Vasco de Gama had sailed around the continent to India.

**The Voyages of Columbus:** Columbus deliberated for many years before his infamous voyage of 1492, from studying ocean currents and winds to finding financial support.

1. Christopher Columbus from Italy spent years of studying the factors of the ocean before his voyage to try to find a route to Asia in 1492, but he ended up miscalculating the size of the earth, resulting in his landing in the Americas instead of his intended destination.
2. Before his planned voyage, Columbus had difficulty finding funding for his expedition, but eventually was backed by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, who had just finished the _reconquista_ of Spain.

**Columbus in the New World:** Upon Columbus landing on the Bahamas and later Hispaniola, the Europeans began their colonization efforts in the Americas, believing in the opportunity from the unknown continent discovered as a result of attempting to find a westward route to Asia.

1. On October 12, 1492, Columbus landed on the Bahamas and later discovered the island if Hispaniola (modern-day Haiti and Dominican Republic), which took him 33 days of continuous sailing.
2. The next year after Columbus' voyage, Europeans immediately began colonizing the Americas, which began on Columbus' Spanish outpost on Hispaniola - however, it was not realized that they had found an unknown continent until the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian sailing along South America.

**Exploration and Conquest:** Shortly after the voyage of Columbus, Europeans (especially the Spanish) began sponsoring many expeditions to the Americas, giving rise to many European accomplishments including the world's first worldwide voyage and the European sight of the Pacific Ocean as well as conquerings, such as that of the capital of the Aztec Empire.

1. Rapidly after Columbus' voyage, Europeans began sending more expeditions, especially because of the transmission of information made possible by the invention of the European printing press.
2. The Spanish lead global efforts to explore the Americas in an attempt to increase their wealth and Catholicism across the world, namely with Vasco Nunez de Balboa in 1513 finding the Pacific Ocean as the first European and Ferdinand Magellan with the first exploration around the world.
3. Hernan Cortes of 1519 became the first of the explorers to find a major civilization when he landed on Tenochtitlan, which was the heart of the wealthy and large Aztec empire.
4. Because the Aztecs were warriors, a conflict ensued with the Spanish, and Cortes ended up conquering Tenochtitlan with their guns, iron weapons, and the spread of disease that wiped out much of Aztec society.

**The Demographic Disaster:** The exposure of Europeans to the Native Americans caused one of the largest amount of deaths in human history, due to the new diseases they were exposed to, the superiority of European technology, and their enslavement.

1. The Columbian exchange, referring to the transfer of goods, people, and diseases between the Old World and the New World, introuced crops like corn, tomatoes, and potatoes to Europe and wheat, rice, and horses to the New World.
2. Because of the arrival of the Europeans, the American Indian population drastically declined - by some estimates, over 85 million people died due to disease or other causes.
3. Part of the cause for this population decline included coming into contact with diseases that the Indians were not immune to as well as wars and enslavement.
4. This tragic decrease of population along with technology is what allowed the Europeans to conquer the Americas quickly and effectively.


**The Spanish Empire:** The expanse of the Spanish empire included many resource-rich areas and stretched across Europe to the Americas, allowing for accessible trade and wealth production.

1. Spain created an expansive empire by the time they had created successful colonies in the Americas, which allowed their trade to be more mobilized than ever as Spanish ships carried gold and silver across oceans for trade.
2. At its height, the Spanish Empire controlled many wealthy parts of the world in the Americas and in Europe as well as the natural resources that they contained.

**Governing Spanish America:** Spanish American government was created to be a very robust system that replaced the destructive behavior of the conquistadores, made up of appointed bureaucrats and lawyers that organized the colony.

1. The system of government that Spain instituted in their new colonies to replace the destructive conquistadores was made up of lawyers and bureaucrats that became stable and effective.
2. The officials that made up the Spanish American governance were appointed by the crown of Spain instead of being elected by the people they governed.

**Colonists in Spanish America:** Spanish American colonies were generally large and thus did not require African slaves for farm and mining labor, but continued to exploit the native populations in forced labor and prevented those who were not Spanish from settling there.

1. Spanish American farms and plantations did not require the import of African slaves because of its relatively large population; Spanish landlords instead forced the Native Americans to work in mines and _haciendas_, or large commercial farms.
2. The Spanish American government prevented non-Spaniards from immigrating to its colonies, and many of the people that were allowed to settle in the Spanish colonies were government officials, priests, or skilled workers.

**Colonists and Indians:** Colonists made up only a small part of the population of their colonies, and Indians were eventually given certain rights and assimilated with the Spanish to create a mixed culture.

1. The population of Spanish colonists never grew to be more than a small percentage of the total population in the colonies, which largely consisted of Native Americans that were granted some rights in the colonial society and could be assimilated. 
2. The Spanish government mandated that the wives of immigrants to the Spanish colonies were to move with them, and the single men of the colonies were required to marry. Because there were fewer Spanish women, Native Americans would often be married with Spaniards, which created the _mestizo_ population of mixed cultures.

**Justifications for Conquest:** The Europeans used both the thought that they were culturally superior as well as their religious agenda to evangelize as justification for their conquest of the Americas.

1. Europeans in their justification for claiming the lands of the Native Americans, were confident in their own cultural superiority with nay other Native American population that approached them.
2. The Europeans have an extensive history of violent actions to advance their colonization efforts, but their missionary works for Catholicism were also prevalent in their colonization efforts of the Americas.

**Spreading the Faith:** The spread of Catholicism became a primary goal for the Spanish as the pope made it mandatory for colonization, and many missionaries came to America to convert the Indians as a result.

1. The pope reinforced the religious purpose for the explorations by making the spread of Catholicism a prerequisite for colonization, at a time when the church was split by reformer Martin Luther who accused the Church of corruption.
2. Responding to the call of the pope, Spain expanded its missionary attempts to convert the Indians and claimed that their mission was to save the Indians from heathenism or Protestantism.

**Piety and Profit:** The Native Americans were both evangelized to and exploited as the Spanish attempted to both convert them to Catholicism and forced them to work in their mines to extract gold and silver.

1. In addition to being a primary target for missionaries, the Native Americans were seen as a beneficial work source for the Europeans in their gold and silver mines, which the Spanish justified by claiming that they were providing them truer freedom through organizing them.
2. Despite the harsh conditions of the forced labor that the Native Americans were subject to that caused many deaths, the Spanish could see no incompatibility between growing in wealth through the exploitation of the natives and attempting to better them through Catholicism.

**Las Casas's Complaint:** Protest against the treatment of the Indians began with the outlawing of Indian slavery by Pope Paul III and continued with Priest Bartolome de Las Casas, who wrote a scathing account of their brutal treatment in the Americas.

1. A decade and a half after the outlawing of Indian enslavement, a Dominican priest named Bartolome de Las Casas released a written account of the condition of the Indians, which contained criticism for the Spanish treatment of the natives.
2. Las Casas, in _A Very Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies_, describes what he calls a "massacre" of the Indians, finding their labor circumstances and treatment to be inhumane.

**Reforming the Empire:** Reforms were passed to somewhat improve the condition of the Indians, including the New Laws of 1542 that forbade their slavery and allowed them to receive wages for work, but Spain remained what European nations called "The Black Legend," for their continued cruel treatment of the natives.

1. Las Casas believed that the oppression of the Spanish destroyed the credibility of Catholic missionary efforts, and largely due to his work, Spain passed the New Laws of 1542 that prevented any Indians from Spanish slavery and allowed them to receive wages.
2. The Spanish among the other European nations became known as the Black Legend for the gross descriptions of abusive behavior as written by Las Casas, but they remained this way, using forced wage labor and African slave labor to develop their land.

**Exploring North America:** The Spanish, in an effort to look for another civilization with gold, explored the North American continent into modern-day United States, venturing into the Great Plains, Oregon, and the Southwest without finding the gold they sought.

1. From Mexico and Peru, the Spanish continued to explore into modern-day United States in search of a new civilization with gold, entering first through Florida in 1513.
2. Spanish exploration continued by sea into modern-day Oregon and by land into the Southwest and Gulf regions, looking for but failing to find a resource-rich area like Mexico or Peru.

**Spanish Florida:** The Spanish created a colony in Florida primarily for military purposes and preventing French colonization, but it failed to gain a significant amount of settlers.

1. Spain created their first colony that was in modern-day United States at Florida, where they hoped to create a military base to prevent French explorers from beginning to colonize.
2. The military base in Miami soon was one of many stretching into South Carolina while religious missionaries attempted to convert local Indians to Christianity.

**Spain in the Southwest:** Spain colonized the Southwest almost half a century after failing to find gold in the area, but upon settling permanently, they came into conflict with the local Indians.

1. The Southwest was not colonized by Spain until after the failed expeditions to find gold in the area, when they built a permanent colony there and Spanish soldiers were killed by local Indians from present-day New Mexico.
2. In an act of revenge, the leader of the expedition, Juan de Onate, laid siege to the city of the Indians and killed hundreds of its people.

**The Pueblo Revolt:** As a result of increased Spanish oppression on the religious practices of the Pueblo Indians, the Indians revolted and successfully drove the Spanish out of the area.

1. In New Mexico in the 1680's, relationships between a small, controlling mestizo minority and the Pueblo Indians began crumbling as the Spanish sought to stamp out their traditional religion by burning their sacred objects and idols.
2. Although the Pueblo Indians were a divided people, an Indian named Popé led a united uprising against the Spanish in an attempt to drive them from their colony and restore their cultural traditions.
3. After secret meetings within Pueblo communities, Popé coordinated an uprising of 2,000 that killed hundreds of colonists and missionaries and destroyed Spanish buildings, forcing the Spanish to abandon the area.
